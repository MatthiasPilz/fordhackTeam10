## The Issue
Routing apps get you to your exact destination while parking apps today focus on two core dimensions: location and cost. This means multiple apps and no personalisation currently present in the market. Considerate drivers, however, want to get guided to their destination with preferred parking spaces being nearby. ParkSense gets you to where you need to be while parking where you want to park.

## Our Magic Solution
ParkSense is an app for the considerate driver, who looks to make conscious parking location decisions according to their preferences. Combining industry defining data sources like the Kerbspace API with our proprietary ParkSense algorithm, our solution offers you the choice of parking slots, allowing anyone from those who feel most vulnerable to the budget conscious driver to find where to park.

## How It Works
1. Create a profile of the preferences that mean the most to you.
2. Enter the point of interest which you are looking to reach.
3. ParkSense will guide you along the route on which the most relevant parking spots are located.
